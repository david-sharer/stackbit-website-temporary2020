A physical cube that knows how you're holding it. Solve the puzzle of lights!

> A few months prior to the Seattle Indies Game Jam, we wanted to make an alt controller game that appeared as a mysterious artifact setting on a table. "It should look like an ominous cube. When picked up, it should interact in an odd way. It should know the orientation and way in which it's being held, and respond accordingly." In the month prior to the game jam, David got a membership to a makerspace (CoMotion) and ramped up on skills for creating custom hardware and researching materials. It didn't quite end up as ominous as intended (turns out there's no decently touch-sensitive, semi-transparent material that's a reasonable price), but everything else is about right.

- 8 Capacitive Touch Panels (Copper Tape on the Corners)
- 9-DoF Accelerometer (unused in the first game)
- 500mAh battery (grants about 1h of normal use)
- 48 individually addressable RGB LEDs
- Qi charger compatible
- Piezo buzzer
